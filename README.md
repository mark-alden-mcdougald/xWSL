     Installing xWSL Distro [XFCE416] to "C:\WSL Distros\XFCE416"
     This will take a few minutes, please wait...

The installer will download and install the [LxRunOffline](https://github.com/DDoSolitary/LxRunOffline) distro manager and [Windows Store Ubuntu image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-bm/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?).  Reference times will vary depending on system performance and the presence of antivirus software.  A fast system with good Internet can finish in under 10 minutes.

       - xRDP Server listening on port 13399 and SSHd on port 13322.

       - Links for GUI and Console sessions have been placed on your desktop.

       - (Re)launch init from the Task Scheduler or by running the following command:
         schtasks /run /tn XFCE416
     
      XFCE416 Installation Complete!  GUI will start in a few seconds...

A fullscreen XFCE session will launch using your stored credentials. 

**Configure xWSL to start at boot (like a service, no console window)**

* Right-click the task in Task Scheduler, click properties
* Click the checkbox for **Run whether user is logged on or not** and click **OK**
* Enter your Windows credentials when prompted
 
Reboot your PC when complete and xWSL will startup automatically.

**Start/Stop Operation**

* Reboot the instance (example with default distro name of 'xWSL'): ````schtasks /run /tn xWSL```` 
* Terminate the instance: ````wslconfig /t xWSL````

**xWSL leverages Multicast DNS to lookup WSL2 instances**

If your computer has virtualization support you can convert it to WSL2.  xWSL is faster on WSL1, but WSL2 has additional capabilities. 

Example of conversion to WSL2 on machine name "ENVY":
 - Stop WSL on ENVY:
    ````wsl --shutdown````
 - Convert the instance to WSL2:
    ````wsl --set-version xWSL 2````
 - Restart kWSL Instance:
    ````schtasks /run /tn xWSL````
 - Edit the RDP file on your desktop to point at the WSL2 instance by adding ````-xWSL.local```` to the hostname:
    ````ENVY-xWSL.local:3399````

**Make it your own:**

From a security standpoint, it would be best to fork this project so you (and only you) control the packages and files in the repository.

- Sign into GitHub and fork this project
- Edit ```xWSL.cmd```.  On line 2 you will see ```SET GITORG=mark-alden-mcdougald``` - Change ```mark-alden-mcdougald``` to the name of your own repository.
- Customize the script any way you like.
- Launch the script using your repository name:
 ```PowerShell -executionpolicy bypass -command "wget https://github.com/mark-alden-mcdougald/xWSL/raw/master/xWSL.cmd -UseBasicParsing -OutFile xWSL.cmd ; .\xWSL.cmd"```

**Quirks / Limitations / Additional Info:**

* When you log out out of a desktop session the entire xWSL instance is restarted, the equivilent of a clean-boot at every login.  
* xWSL should work fine with an X Server instead of xRDP. The file **/etc/profile.d/xWSL.sh** contains WSL-centric environment variables that may need adjustment such as LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT.
* WSL1 Doesn't work with PolicyKit. Enabled gksu for apps needing elevated rights (Synaptic, root console)
* Rebuilt xrdp 0.9.13 thanks to Sergey Dryabzhinsky @ http://packages.rusoft.ru/ppa/rusoft/xrdp/
* [Apt-fast](https://github.com/ilikenwf/apt-fast) added to improve download speed and reliability.
* Mozilla Seamonkey included as a stable browser that's kept up to date via apt.  Current versions of Chrome / Firefox do not work in WSL1.
* Installed image consumes approximately 2.6 GB of disk space
* XFCE uses the Plata (light or dark) theme and Windows fonts (Segoe UI / Cascadia Code)
* This is a basic installation of XFCE to save bandwidth.  If you want the complete XFCE Desktop environment run `sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop`
* Uninstaller is located in root of xWSL folder, **'Uninstall xWSL.cmd'** - Make sure you **'Run As Administrator'** to ensure removal of the scheduled task and firewall rules
